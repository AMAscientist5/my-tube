        Discuss the scope of var, let, and const ?
      </h3>

      <ul >
        <li>
        <b>  var:</b> Function-scoped,could access everywhere in the function. Hoisted to
          the top of its function
        </li>
        <li>
         <b> let:</b> Let is a Block-scoped variable, visible only within the block-scoped (between curly
          braces) where it is declared.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>const:</b> Const block-scoped like let. Used for constants; once a value is
          assigned, it cannot be reassigned.

        Tell us the use cases of null and undefined ?
      </h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
         <b> Null:</b> When variable is declared but value not assigned a intentionally,
          can be set to null to explicitly indicate that have no
          value. It's sometime very useful  In some cases, to initialize a variable to null to
          indicate that it hasn't been assigned a value yet, and then assign value later.
        </li>
        <li>
         <b> Undefined:</b> Variables that have not been declared or
          assigned the value have an undefined value. Undefined can
          be used in some cases for error handling or missing data in the code.
